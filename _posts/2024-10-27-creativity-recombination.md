"Art is a mechanism that is always trying to destroy itself, always questioning what is or not is art"


Those were the words that my uncle, the artist Pipo Hernandez, told me in a burger in Madrid. In that moment I knew what my Master's thesis would be about. 

(You can check his work [here](https://nfgaleria.com/artista/pipo-hernandez-rivero/) if you like. I personally love it!)

Some months later I delivered my Master's thesis called "Alien Recombination: Exploring Concept Blends Beyond Human Cognitive Availability" at the Technical University of Munich. I carried out this research along the Center of Human and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, a phenomenal team of researchers, with help also of the Max Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems.

In this project we thought about ways to make machines more creative. This is a very ambitious goal to be honest, a master's thesis is not enough to tackle this problem in full depth, mostly because we do not know exactly where the problem ends. Creativity is such a hard to define concept and a very subjective one. For instance, some people consider LLMs to be already creative, while others do not.

In this post, I will write about the nature of creativity and the problems of implementing it in a machine, as well as ways we could improve it. Note that this is not a scientific article, nor does it pretend to be. It is an exercise to verbalize my thoughts and to foster dialogue and new ideas about this topic I find so fascinating.

To-do:
- Boden creativity
- Remember and imagination as reconstruction
- Our thesis and our hypothesis
- Creative reasoning is very difficult to track, but it could composed of multiple transformations in an multidimensional space
- Open-endedness

## What is creativity?

Creativity is a difficult concept to grasp. Some view it as a process that emerges from imagination [1], where imagination is seen as a reconstructive process based on prior knowledge [2]. Others define it as the process by which an individual generates new ideas or patterns using the symbols of a given domain [3]. Additionally, some interpretations view creativity as a fully combinatorial process, involving the combination of existing representations [4][5]. 

In computer science, one of the most influential definitions of creativity comes from Margaret Boden [6], who describes it as "the ability to come up with ideas or artifacts that are new, surprising, and valuable." [7] This definition is particularly useful because it breaks creativity into measurable components: valuable, meaning the output is of high quality and socially accepted; novel, meaning the artifact is significantly different from others in its class; and surprising, meaning the result deviates from expectations.

In addition, Boden identifies three types of creativity:

• Combinatorial creativity: This involves making unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas. An example of this is creating a new recipe by pairing unexpected ingredients, such as chocolate and chili.

• Exploratory creativity: This focuses on finding new solutions within an existing style or set of rules, like a jazz musician improvising a melody while adhering to standard chord progressions.

• Transformational creativity: This involves completely changing the current way of thinking. A classic example is Einstein's theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time, or Picasso's cubist paintings, which redefined artistic expression and deeply transformed 20th-century art.

Combinatorial creativity is often considered the most basic form of creativity. Some studies suggest that LLMs are primarily limited to this type of creativity, lacking the deeper transformative or exploratory capabilities associated with the other two types [8].
