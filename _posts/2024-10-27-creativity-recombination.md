"Art is a mechanism that is always trying to destroy itself, always questioning what is or not is art"


Those were the words that my uncle, the artist Pipo Hernandez, told me in a burger in Madrid. In that moment I knew what my Master's thesis would be about. 

(You can check his work [here](https://nfgaleria.com/artista/pipo-hernandez-rivero/) if you like. I personally love it!)

Some months later I delivered my Master's thesis called "Alien Recombination: Exploring Concept Blends Beyond Human Cognitive Availability" at the Technical University of Munich. I carried out this research along the Center of Human and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, a phenomenal team of researchers, with help also of the Max Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems (in particular, the super clever Nasim Rahaman). 

In this project we thought about ways to make machines more creative. This is a very ambitious goal to be honest, a master's thesis is not enough to tackle this problem in full depth, mostly because we do not know exactly where the problem ends. Creativity is such a hard to define concept and a very subjective one. For instance, some people consider LLMs to be already creative, while others do not.

In this post, inspired by the work we did and all the things I learned during the thesis, I will write about the nature of creativity and the problems of implementing it in a machine, as well as ways we could improve it. Note that this is not a scientific article, nor does it pretend to be. It is an exercise to verbalize my thoughts and to foster dialogue and new ideas about this topic I find so fascinating.

To-do:
- Boden creativity
- Remember and imagination as reconstruction
- Our thesis and our hypothesis
- Creative reasoning is very difficult to track, but it could composed of multiple transformations in an multidimensional space
