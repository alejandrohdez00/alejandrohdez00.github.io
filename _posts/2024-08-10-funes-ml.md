During my research internship at CSIC, I had the opportunity to work on a project exploring the relationship between memory and machine learning under the supervision of Jesús Marco de Lucas. Our research focused on the work of Rodrigo Q. Quiroga regarding concept cells and the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and learning, as well as how this concept abstraction works in machine learning. This topic was already fascinating, but I was immensely surprised to discover that Quiroga had written a book connecting Borges and memory [1]. He relates Borges's story "Funes the Memorious" to how memory works and its significance for learning. 

I have been in love with Borges writing since my first year of undergraduate studies, so I found this connection especially interesting. Naturally, I read Quiroga's book, and it inspired me to follow a similar path. While Quiroga's book moves from Borges to memory, I plan to start from his insights and explore how they connect memory to machine learning research. In particular, how concepts are encoded in machine learning models and their importance for learning.



## Funes the Memorious

Let's begin with a brief overview of the narrative. Nevertheless, I urge you to immerse yourself in the story directly - it spans less than 10 pages - since any summary will inevitably fall short in capturing the full depth and magnitude of Borges's work. Additionally, I'll be incorporating several direct quotes from the story, as I think there's no better way to convey the intricacies of the discussed concepts than through Borges' own words.

Funes the Memorious is the story of a man who, after a severe head injury, discovers an extraordinary ability - or perhaps, a curse - that grants him the capacity to remember every single detail with impeccable clarity. The argument is simple, but the real genius of Borges is that he explores the consequences of this power with his superb imagination, crafting a response that is both realistic, profound and oppressive. As we will see, Borges, without any formal knowledge of neuroscience, intuitively predicts the potential repercussions of such an ability with striking accuracy.

The author describes Funes' talent in the following way:

> We, at one glance, can perceive three glasses on a table; Funes, all the leaves and tendrils and fruit that make up a grape vine. He knew by heart the forms of the southern clouds at dawn on the 30th of April, 1882, and could compare them in his memory with the mottled streaks on a book in Spanish binding he had only seen once and with the outlines of the foam raised by an oar in the Rio Negro the night before the Quebracho uprising.

Funes, in his bed, spends his time memorising whole encyclopaedias and remembering whole days, which takes a day for him. Moreover, he undertakes the creation of a novel numerical system, assigning each number a unique concept that he can effortlessly recall. Yet, beyond the external manifestations of this extraordinary power, Funes undergoes a profound internal transformation, altering the very mechanisms of his thought.

> Not only was it difficult for him to comprehend that the generic symbol "dog" embraces so many unlike individuals of diverse size and form; it bothered him that the dog at three fourteen (seen from the side) should have the same name as the dog at three fifteen (seen from the front). His own face in the mirror, his own hands, surprised him every time he saw them.

As we can see, after his injury, Funes starts to have trouble generalising concepts. This difficulty extends to his sleep patterns, as Funes grapples with insomnia. The paradox becomes apparent: to sleep, one must engage in the act of forgetting, a faculty that Funes no longer possesses.

Finally, Borges concludes the narrative with a succinct yet profound observation on the intricacies of thought - something that eludes Funes in his altered state.

> With no effort, he had learned English, French, Portuguese and Latin. I suspect, however, that he was not very capable of thought. To think is to forget differences, generalize, make abstractions. In the teeming world of Funes, there were only details, almost immediate in their presence.

In short, as Borges usually does in many of his stories, he starts with a simple premise: *the life of a man who can remember everything* and he geniously arrives at a profound conclusion: *To think, we must forget*.

## Funes in Real Life

The subsequent section, now exploring neuroscience and real experiments, draws heavily from Rodrigo Quian Quiroga's book "Borges and memory" [1], which I also highly recommend.

Solomon Shereshevskii, a journalist at a Moscow newspaper renowned for his extraordinary memory, started a remarkable research journey after a co-worker suggested he consult with psychologist Alexander Romanovich Luria. In their initial meeting, Shereshevskii astonished Luria with his prodigious memory, effortlessly reproducing sequences of up to 70 random letters or numbers. Moreover he was able to recite the sequences backwards, irrespective of whether they consisted of sounds, numbers, or words - Shershevskii simply visualized them in his memory and could effortlessly recall them.

On another experiment, Luria asked him to recall a random mathematical formula:

$$ N * \sqrt{d^2 * \frac{85}{vx}} * \sqrt[3]{\frac{267^2 * 86x}{n^2v * \pi264}}n^2b = sv\frac{1624}{32^2} $$

Not only did he repeat the formula without error, but he was able to reconstruct it 15 years later (not knowing that Luria would ask him again).

Shereshevskii's extraordinary memory was based on a strong synaesthesia. That is, mixing the perceptions of different senses; for example, associating numbers with colours. This can be seen by reading the notes that Luria took of his conversations:

> I recognise a word not only by the images it evokes, but also by a whole complex of sensations that the image triggers. It's difficult to explain…, it's not a question of vision or hearing, it's a general sense I have. I usually feel the taste and the weight of a word and I don't need to make an effort to remember it: it seems that the word appears by itself.

Finally, after Luria's failure to measure Shereshevskii's memory total capacity, he investigated another possibility, very aligned with Borges's intuition: Was Shereshevskii capable of forgetting?

It resulted that forgetting was a task of Herculean proportions for him. As a consequence, Shereshevskii encountered considerable challenges in abstract thinking and reading comprehension. Despite his capacity to memorize entire pages of a book, he struggled with isolating the content to grasp its underlying meaning. Unlike the typical process where individuals extract and remember key facts to follow a narrative, Shereshevskii found himself inundated with a miriad of associations after reading just four lines.

As he describes himself below, he also had great trouble recognising voices and faces, another symptom of his inability to abstract concepts and one of the curses of his condition.

> I became so interested in his voice [referring to the voice of filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein] that I couldn't follow what he was saying…. But there are people whose voices are constantly changing. I often have trouble recognising someone's voice on the phone, and it's not because of a bad connection. It's because the person is someone who changes their voice twenty or thirty times during the course of a day. People don't notice this, but I do.
A person's expression depends on their mood and the circumstances in which they find themselves. People's faces are constantly changing; it is these different forms of expression that confuse me and make it so difficult to remember faces.

Following this examination, fascinating parallels emerge between Shereshevskii and Funes. Actually, it is surprising how well Borges predicted the impact that an enormous memory capacity could have on a human being, relying purely on intuition. I find particularly interesting the example of the faces, since it relates quite well to Funes's inability to generalise the concept of dog, as Borges describes.

## Henry Molaison or the Anti-Funes

Henry Molaison (1926-2008) began experiencing epileptic seizures at age 10. His condition worsened during his teenage years, becoming resistant to even the strongest medications. By age 27, the severity of his seizures forced him to leave his job at a motor assembly plant.

At this point, neurosurgeon William Scoville proposed an experimental surgery as a last resort. Scoville had previously performed similar procedures on psychotic patients, who showed improvement after the removal of portions of their frontal lobe. With Molaison's consent, Scoville surgically removed the hippocampus and surrounding areas from both hemispheres of his brain.

The surgery succeeded in controlling Molaison's epileptic seizures, but it also radically changed both his life and the history of neuroscience, revolutionizing our understanding of memory.

Molaison appeared to recover normally from the surgery until a devastating side effect became apparent. He could no longer recognize the hospital staff, find his way to the bathroom, or remember daily events. In essence, Molaison had lost the ability to form new memories, a condition known as anterograde amnesia (not retrograde amnesia, which refers to the loss of memories formed before the onset of amnesia).

He couldn't remember where things were in his house, would solve the same puzzles repeatedly without any learning, and read the same magazines over and over, never recognizing their content. Molaison lived in a constant past and a ephemeral present, which inevitably, was continuously vanishing.

However, Molaison could recall events from before his surgery. His language abilities remained intact, he could maintain conversations without difficulty and understand jokes. These capabilities require both reasoning and short-term memory, demonstrating that these cognitive functions were preserved.

When Molaison saw himself in mirrors or recent photographs, he couldn't recognize himself, as his mental self-image remained frozen at age 27, when he had the surgery. He often described a persistent feeling of being lost. When we sleep in a hotel, we sometimes experience a brief moment of confusion, until our memory kicks in and provides the context to explain why we are there. However, Molaison lived perpetually in this state of confusion.

He described his life as constantly "waking up from a dream." There's a curious antithesis here with Funes the Memorious, which Borges described as a metaphor for insomnia, where all details and memories remain permanently, oppressively present.

Thanks to Molaison's case and subsequent studies, we now understand the crucial role of the hippocampus in forming new memories. However, it's important to note that the hippocampus doesn't actually store memories itself. Instead, it acts as a processor, compiling experiences into memories and storaging them in other parts of the brain. This explains why Molaison could recall pre-surgery memories, they were already stored in his brain, but couldn't form new ones. Without his hippocampus, he lacked the neural mechanism necessary to process new experiences into lasting memories for later storage.

## Hippocampus and Concept Cells

As Borger suggest, in order to think, we need to abstract concepts and relate them, we need to forget some information. This involves focusing on the essential aspects while disregarding minor details, essentially operating at a more fundamental level of understanding.

This lead us to a very intriguing and relevant discovery done by Quiroga [2]. He found that the brain contains a subset of multimodal neurons, which respond to clusters of abstract concepts centered around a common, high-level theme rather than specific visual features. This discovery originated from studies on epileptic patients, where researchers used intracranial electrodes to observe how neurons reacted to different conceptual images presented in various formats. For instance, in the image below, we see a neuron in the entorhinal cortex, the primary interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex, that fires only when the patient is presented with the **concept** of "Luke Skywalker." This response occurs regardless of whether the concept is conveyed through an image, text, or audio. Interestingly, the same neuron also fires in response to the concept of Yoda.

Later, in his opinion paper Quiroga called them "concept cells" or "concept neurons" [4]. 


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/images/luke.jpg" alt="Luke" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

This demonstrates that the concept neurons in the hippocampus (and surrounding areas) encode representations at such a high level of abstraction that they can be triggered by different types of stimuli. Furthermore, Quiroga showed that these abstract representations can form rapidly. In one experiment, he and his team presented photos and text of themselves to patients who had only known them for two days. Remarkably, the patients already had neurons that fired in response to their photos and names.

Nevertheless, using a single neuron to encode each concept would be inefficient and would fail to capture the relationships between concepts. Instead, as Quiroga suggests in his opinion paper, overlapping representations may be key to learning associations.

Imagine a cell assembly, a group of neurons, that encodes the concept of 'Luke Skywalker'. Some neurons in this assembly also respond to Yoda, while others also fire in response to Darth Vader. When the 'Luke Skywalker cell assembly' is activated (for example, when seeing his picture), it can trigger associated concepts like Yoda or Darth Vader through these overlapping neural patterns. This happens because neurons that participate in multiple concept representations act as bridges, allowing pattern completion to activate related concepts.
These partially overlapping representations could form the neural basis for how we encode and learn associations and episodic memories.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/images/graph-luke.png" alt="Luke-graph" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto;">
</div>

In short, the same neuron can fire for different but related concepts (like Luke Skywalker and Yoda), and there are very few of these neurons, each responding to only a few specific concepts. This is called a sparse representation, and it is also widely used in machine learning, for example in sparse autoencoders that encode information using sparse vectors [3] (vectors where most values are 0 and only a few have non-zero values).

When you see a photo of Luke Skywalker in a magazine, the initial visual recognition occurs in the inferior temporal gyrus; you don't need the Luke Skywalker concept neuron for this. However, this concept neuron is crucial for transforming that visual perception into a memory, allowing you to later recall seeing Luke Skywalker's photo in the magazine. These concept neurons represent the abstract concepts we use to form and store memories. Their role in memory formation makes sense because we typically remember general concepts (people, events, places) rather than exact details.

But this post is about Funes, memory and machine learning, right? So how does all this information connect to Funes?

Funes represents the extreme example of a person without the ability to abstract. Quiroga hypothesizes that without concept neurons, we would be like Funes, unable to abstract or categorize, only capable of remembering precise, uncompressed details of everything we experience, but paradoxically unable to truly think. This highlights a fundamental insight: thinking is the process of abstracting, associating concepts, and creating relationships between them. These conceptual associations then help strengthen our memories and allow us to recall them later.

## Concepts in Machine Learning

Now, we will connect this crucial idea of abstraction to machine learning. Actually, there is already a very beatiful paper that is inspired by multimodal neuros as discovered by Quiroga. The paper is called "Multimodal neurons in artificial neural networks" and is from OpenAI, in particular from intepretability researches I really admire such as Chris Olah (he has a fantastic blog in which you can learn a lot about machine learning: [Link](https://colah.github.io/))

Let's analyze it a bit. Authors discovered that individual neurons in CLIP [5] can recognize abstract concepts across different forms, from photographs to drawings to written words, suggesting that both artificial and human brains might share a fundamental approach to understanding the world by organizing information into high-level semantic concepts.

But how do they analyze CLIP's individual neurons? They use two main approaches to understand what individual neurons are actually doing, like a neuroscientist like Quiroga, using different tests to understand brain function.

The first method, feature visualization, generates images by using gradient ascent optimization to find input patterns that maximally activate specific neurons. Starting with random noise, the algorithm gradually tweaks and refines the pixels until it creates an image that strongly excites the target neuron, similar to playing a game of "warmer/colder" where each adjustment is guided by how strongly the neuron responds. The resulting generated images, while often abstract, provide direct evidence of the features and patterns each neuron has learned to detect during training. I strongly recommend reading (again) Chris Olah's brilliant post on Inceptionism ([Link](https://research.google/blog/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural-networks/)). It provides a clear overview while showcasing the beauty of this concept and of neural networks in general.

The second approach is more straightforward: researchers feed dataset examples through CLIP and keep track of which examples make each neuron fire most strongly. By examining these "greatest hits" for each neuron, patterns emerge.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/images/paper-example_.png" alt="Luke-graph" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

What's particularly interesting about CLIP is that its neurons often turn out to be "multi-faceted" - meaning a single neuron might respond strongly to both photographs and drawings of the same concept, or even to written words describing that concept. For example, a single neuron might light up for photos of dogs, cartoon dogs, and even the word "dog" - suggesting it's learned to recognize the concept of "dog" across different forms of representation.

This two-pronged approach has revealed that most neurons in CLIP are surprisingly interpretable, giving us valuable insights into how the model connects the worlds of images and language. It's like discovering that what initially looked like a black box is actually filled with specialized workers, each doing a specific but flexible job in bridging the gap between visual and textual understanding.
