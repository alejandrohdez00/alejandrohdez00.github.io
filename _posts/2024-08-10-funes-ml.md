Renowned for his mastery over the concept of infinity, Borges seamlessly weaves it into various tales, be it the infinite library in "The Library of Babel" (coming soon an article about this one) or the profound notion of "The Aleph," a singular point from which the entirety of space unfolds. However, our focus in this article shifts to a narrative that navigates the expanses of infinity on a distinct scale: exploring the boundless labyrinths of memory and delving into the repercussions of possessing an unlimited reservoir of recollections.

Funes the Memorious is the story of a man who, after a severe head injury, discovers an extraordinary ability - or perhaps, a curse - that grants him the capacity to remember every single detail with impeccable clarity.

Borges, not tethered to scientific expertise, wonders about the consequences of this power with his superb imagination, crafting a response that is both realistic, profound and oppresive.

## Funes the Memorious

Let's begin with a brief overview of the narrative. Nevertheless, I urge you to immerse yourself in the story directly - it spans less than 10 pages - since any summary will inevitably fall short in capturing the full depth and magnitude of Borges's work. Additionally, I'll be incorporating several direct quotes from the story, as I think there's no better way to convey the intricacies of the discussed concepts than through Borges' own words.

The author describes Funes' talent in the following way:

> We, at one glance, can perceive three glasses on a table; Funes, all the leaves and tendrils and fruit that make up a grape vine. He knew by heart the forms of the southern clouds at dawn on the 30th of April, 1882, and could compare them in his memory with the mottled streaks on a book in Spanish binding he had only seen once and with the outlines of the foam raised by an oar in the Rio Negro the night before the Quebracho uprising.

Funes, in his bed, spends his time memorising whole encyclopaedias and remembering whole days, which takes a day for him. Moreover, he undertakes the creation of a novel numerical system, assigning each number a unique concept that he can effortlessly recall. Yet, beyond the external manifestations of this extraordinary power, Funes undergoes a profound internal transformation, altering the very mechanisms of his thought.

> Not only was it difficult for him to comprehend that the generic symbol "dog" embraces so many unlike individuals of diverse size and form; it bothered him that the dog at three fourteen (seen from the side) should have the same name as the dog at three fifteen (seen from the front). His own face in the mirror, his own hands, surprised him every time he saw them.

As we can see, after his injury, Funes starts to have trouble generalising concepts. This difficulty extends to his sleep patterns, as Funes grapples with insomnia. The paradox becomes apparent: to sleep, one must engage in the act of forgetting, a faculty that Funes no longer possesses.

Finally, Borges concludes the narrative with a succinct yet profound observation on the intricacies of thought - something that eludes Funes in his altered state.

> With no effort, he had learned English, French, Portuguese and Latin. I suspect, however, that he was not very capable of thought. To think is to forget differences, generalize, make abstractions. In the teeming world of Funes, there were only details, almost immediate in their presence.

Through this narrative, Borges explores the very essence of thought, learning, and their intricate connection with memory within the realms of fiction. However, this fictional exploration was not as distant from reality as one might have initially perceived…

## Back to reality

The subsequent section, delving into neuroscience, draws heavily from Rodrigo Quian Quiroga's book "Borges and memory" [1], which I also highly recommend.

Solomon Shereshevskii, a journalist at a Moscow newspaper renowned for his extraordinary memory, embarked on a remarkable research journey after a co-worker suggested he consult with psychologist Alexander Romanovich Luria. In their initial meeting, Shereshevskii astonished Luria with his prodigious memory, effortlessly reproducing sequences of up to 70 random letters or numbers. Moreover he was able to recite the sequences backwards, irrespective of whether they consisted of sounds, numbers, or words - Shershevskii simply visualized them in his memory and could effortlessly recall them.

On another day, Luria asked him to recall a random mathematical formula:

$$ N * \sqrt{d^2 * \frac{85}{vx}} * \sqrt[3]{\frac{267^2 * 86x}{n^2v * \pi264}}n^2b = sv\frac{1624}{32^2} $$

Not only did he repeat the formula without error, but he was able to reconstruct it 15 years later (not knowing that Luria would ask him again).

Shereshevskii's extraordinary memory was based on a strong synaesthesia. That is, mixing the perceptions of different senses; for example, associating numbers with colours. This can be seen by reading the notes that Luria took of his conversations.

> I recognise a word not only by the images it evokes, but also by a whole complex of sensations that the image triggers. It's difficult to explain…, it's not a question of vision or hearing, it's a general sense I have. I usually feel the taste and the weight of a word and I don't need to make an effort to remember it: it seems that the word appears by itself.

Finally, after Luria's failure to measure Shereshevskii's memory capacity, he investigated another possibility: Was Shereshevskii capable of forgetting?

Basically, forgetting was a task of Herculean proportions for him. As a consequence, Shereshevskii encountered considerable challenges in abstract thinking and reading comprehension. Despite his capacity to memorize entire pages of a book, he grappled with isolating the content to grasp its underlying meaning. Unlike the typical process where individuals extract and remember key facts to follow a narrative, Shereshevskii found himself inundated with a miriad of associations after reading just four lines.

As he describes himself below, he also had great trouble recognising voices and faces.

> I became so interested in his voice [referring to the voice of filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein] that I couldn't follow what he was saying…. But there are people whose voices are constantly changing. I often have trouble recognising someone's voice on the phone, and it's not because of a bad connection. It's because the person is someone who changes their voice twenty or thirty times during the course of a day. People don't notice this, but I do.
A person's expression depends on their mood and the circumstances in which they find themselves. People's faces are constantly changing; it is these different forms of expression that confuse me and make it so difficult to remember faces.

Following this examination, noticeable parallels emerge between Shereshevskii and Funes.

## Experimental pause

Pause for a moment before proceeding, and reflect on a past experience. Visualize it in your mind, delving into the details as thoroughly as possible. After you believe you've captured it, challenge yourself to uncover one additional detail. Isn't it quite challenging?
Nature has a way of causing us to forget a considerable portion of our memories. As exemplified by the case of Shereshevski, it appears that maintaining a balance between remembering and forgetting is crucial to fostering comprehension.

## Concept cells and hippocampus

The previous idea can be formalised a little more: In order to think, we need to abstract concepts and relate them. This involves focusing on the essential aspects while disregarding minor details, essentially operating at a more fundamental level of understanding.
This lead us to a very intriguing and relevant discovery done by Quiroga again [2][3]. He discovered that the brain has multimodal neurons. These neurons react to groups of abstract ideas linked by a main theme, rather than specific visual details. Quiroga called them "concept cells".
Concept cells are located in the hippocampal region of the brain and they fire when a meaningful concept to the individual is presented. This discovery was made by studying the neurons of epileptic patients. Researchers used intracranial electrodes to observe the neurons' reactions when the patients were shown various concept images in different formats.
