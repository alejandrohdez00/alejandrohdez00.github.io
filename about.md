Hello! I'm **Alejandro Hernandez** and I love to explore how AI helps us understand the outer universe as well as the inner one: the human brain.

I'm mainly attracted to the intersection of **AI and creativity**, the bidirectional exploration of how AI can help us understand the human creative process and how studying the brain can, in turn, enhance AI's creative abilities. I believe the best way to truly understand something is by building it yourself, and maybe the same holds true for both creativity and the human brain!

In my family, there were no scientists, but rather it was filled with artists! However, instead of following their path, I chose a different route. What truly fascinated me was understanding how people create **cultural artifacts from their experiences, emotions, and associations of ideas**. Especially, I was intrigued by how these variables come together in complex dynamics and combinations, transforming into something powerful enough to make people laugh, cry, or feel a profound connection with themselves, others, and even the universe as a whole.

<!-- I worked as a Research Assistant at CSIC, Spain's leading research organization, where I studied the relation on how artificial neural networks and the human brain store and associate concepts. Later, as a Visiting Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, I focused my Master's thesis on a method for combining concepts to increase the novelty of AI-generated images in visual art. This research was supported by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and was presented at the Technical University of Munich, where it received the highest grade and was also featured at the NeurIPS workshop on Creativity and Generative AI. -->

I enjoy almost all forms of art but I love reading, watching films, going to the theater and the opera. When I have the time, I also enjoy writing about the **philosophical questions AI raises**. In particular, I try to connect ideas from AI or Computer Science with the books Iâ€™m reading. As you can probably tell, building conceptual bridges is what I enjoy most ;).

**Currently, I am applying to PhD programs to continue exploring this intersection of AI and processes and dynamics of creativity!**
